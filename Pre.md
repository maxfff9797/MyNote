# Evaluation of CNN
My fellow here has introduce CNN to you guys ,now I’m going to talk about 3 important network ,based on CNN
## AlexNet
* First,The 8-layers AlexNet,In ILSVRC（ImageNet的图像识别竞赛） 20 12 ,Alexnet won the frist place by reducing the error rate to 16.4%,Which is a huge progress.
* It proved that CNN can be use in a deep,wide Network and is very powerful in Computer Vision. It use GPU to make Calculate faster,which has become popular today.
## ResNet
* Next one is ResNet,Remenber ILSVRC ?In 20 15 ,the MSRA team use a 152-layers ResNet and reduce the error rate to 3.5%.It is a simple and clear framework to train a very deep network with lower training error ,test error and time complexity（时间复杂度）.
* This success advance the Revolution of Deep Network because using ResNet ,you can actually benefit from the increased number of layer. 
## Recurrent Neural Networks
* Last one is Long Short-Term Memory Networks . It is based on RNN（递归神经网络）and better than RNN,Because RNN have gradient Vanishing or Exploding problem ,but LSTM fixed it by using Memory Cell,Which make RNN more practical .
* It has being used on many tesks ,Such as Handwriting recognition ,Semantic analysis and others.It become popular because you can get a very good result by a LSTM with just 2 or 3-layers.
